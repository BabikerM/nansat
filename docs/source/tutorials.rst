Nansat tutorials
================

The package `nansat-lectures
<https://github.com/nansencenter/nansat-lectures/tree/master/notebooks>`_ contains several Jupyter
notebooks with examples of how to use Nansat. Unfortunately, we have not been able to keep them
fully updated. The most recently updated notebooks should, however, work.
