These pixel functions are downloaded as a patch provided by Antonio Valentino:
http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/ticket/3367

To use these in Nansat we have simply to:
- compile contents in this folder with "make"
- include the present folder in the environmental variable "GDAL_DRIVER_PATH"

Note that this must be performed on each users machine, as compiled code is machine-specific!

The file pixelfunctions.c contains all the functions listed in the ticket above
We may add more pixel functions in this file as we need, and then use them as described on
http://www.gdal.org/gdal_vrttut.html

As the pixel functions are a bit awkward to implement, we probably dont want to use them
for our scientific algorithms where we use trial-and-error approach. But it can be very useful for 
common operations such as:
- returning speed (sqrt(u*u+v*v)) when we have two bands with U and V
- returning angle from North for the same input
- returning a difference of two bands
- ...

I have tested it, and can confirm that it works like charm!
